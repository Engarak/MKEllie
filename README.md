# MKEllie
I was tired of using Sockfile to send CIAs via command prompt to my 3DS so I made a Windows front end named MKEllie (name based on the name types used by the CIA programs in the 60s to 70s). I wanted to share it with everyone here as I knew others may have the same feeling. Please let me know if there are any issues/bugs/ suggestions/etc.
To use:
* Download MKEllie (link below)
* Check MD5 Hash (at a place like http://onlinemd5.com/)
* Run the Installer or unzip package for portable
* Run MKEllie from the shortcut (In start menu or desktop) or run MKEllie from unzipped folder from portable
* Make sure to change the IP to the one displayed on your 2DS/3DS
* Click the "Change Rom Path" to browse to the folder where your .cia files are
* Choose the file you want to send
* The information on the game should show on the right with a match percentage (uses http://www.3dsdb.com/ as a source)
* Click Send Game to send the file
* Wait till game is sent and then you're done (status shown on the bottom of the app is a rough estimate)

To do's:
* Find a better DB source
* Find solutions that are more multi-platform
* Fix reported bugs
