# MKEllie
I was tired of using Sockfile to send CIAs via command prompt to my 3DS so I made a Windows front end named MKEllie (name based on the name types used by the CIA programs in the 60s to 70s). I wanted to share it with everyone here as I knew others may have the same feeling. Please let me know if there are any issues/bugs/ suggestions/etc.
To use:
* Download MKEllie (link below)

* Click the "Change Rom Path" to browse to the folder where your .cia files are
* Choose the Games you want to send (supports sending multiple files to FBI 2.0)
